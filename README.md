# EvalML

# Introduction

As per https://evalml.featurelabs.com/en/v0.9.0/- EvalML is an AutoML library that builds, optimizes, and evaluates machine learning pipelines using domain-specific objective functions. 


# Problem statement

This project is based on customer churn datasets. We get the dataset in link-https://www.kaggle.com/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers. I am going to use the EvalML to predict the customers who are going to churn from one service to other service.
This project will consider the following research questions to find out the customers who do not like to stay or churn:
+ What is the accuracy of the machine learning model get from EvalML than other classical machine learning models?
+ What are the best scores that we get after calculation of confusion matrix, classification report and roc auc score applying other machine learning models and EvalML model?


# Problem analysis

I use the EvaML machine learning library to predict the accuracy of the model. I will also compare the other models that we have from sklearn importing and compare the results with EvalML model. My aim is to identify why it is the best library to predict the good accuracy as well as classify the model.
